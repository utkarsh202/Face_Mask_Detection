# Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning

## Purpose

This repository contains a deep learning-based model for face mask detection. The model is trained to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in an image. This project aims to provide a solution that can be used for real-time detection of individuals not wearing masks in various settings.

## Model Architecture

The face mask detection model is built on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, fully connected layers, and output layers with appropriate activation functions to classify images into 'with mask' and 'without mask' categories.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises images of people with and without masks. It consists of approximately X images in the training set and Y images in the testing set. Due to copyright and licensing limitations, the dataset used for this project cannot be provided directly in this repository. However, the dataset sources and necessary instructions for obtaining a similar dataset are listed below.

## How to Run the Code

### Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:
